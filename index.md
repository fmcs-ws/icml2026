# Foundation Models for Computational Science

**ICML 2026 · Seoul, Korea**

## Overview
Large-scale foundation models have transformed machine learning in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision by enabling reusable, scalable, and transferable representations across tasks. However, directly translating this paradigm to computational science presents fundamentally different challenges: scientific problems are governed by physical laws (PDEs, conservation principles, structured discretizations), involve heterogeneous data and complex geometries, and demand reliability, interpretability, and extrapolative generalization beyond typical ML benchmarks.

This workshop brings together researchers from machine learning, numerical analysis, and computational science to critically examine, formalize, and advance the concept of foundation models for computational science. Our goals are to clarify definitions and desiderata, compare emerging methodologies, identify open challenges, and foster community standards for building reusable, transferable, and scientifically grounded surrogate and solver models.
